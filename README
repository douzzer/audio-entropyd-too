The idea for this program was originally by Damien Miller <djm@mindrot.org>.
Since then, a few changes have made.
Especially the algorithm was redone.
Sample-freq was set low, volume to very low to record especially the noise, data is then biased and entropy is calculated.
Also added code that verifies the random data before submitting it to the kernel.
